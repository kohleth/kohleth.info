Hi, I am a Statistician by training, Data Scientist by (current) job title. I have spent some years doing [Biometrics](//www.biometricsociety.org/about/definition-of-biometrics/), and now working with medical professionals, specifically in [Gait Analysis](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_analysis).

The work that I do comes in 3 flavours: 

1. Predictive modelling: Building predictive (machine learning) models and implementing them in real applications.
2. Non-predictive analysis: Many classical non-predictive statistical analysis (e.g. effect estimation, variance components analysis, experimental designs)
3. "Insights" generation: Technically this is just 2., except it is usually done on existing dataset, and the analysis is usually just some simple descriptive statistics accompanied by fancy visualization.

There are many stats/data blog out there but not many are Australian (Melbourne) based (not really interested in the U.S. presidency or the 'bay area' or baseball), so I decided to start one.
