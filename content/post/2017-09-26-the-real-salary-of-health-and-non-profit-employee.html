<p>In Australia, if you work in health or charity, you can salary package a certain amount of your pre-tax income.</p>
<p>That is, you use that pre-tax income to pay for something else, so your total taxable income become less, and you end up earning more than your nominal salary.</p>
<p>A question that comes to mind then is, what is my real salary figure?</p>
<p>To answer this I wrote a little R program:</p>
<pre><code>  tax=function(amount){
    if(amount&lt;=18200)return(0)
    if(amount&lt;=37000)return(0.19*(amount-18200))
    if(amount&lt;=80000)return(3572+0.325*(amount-37000))
    if(amount&lt;=180000)return(17547+0.37*(amount-80000))
    54547+0.45*(amount-180000)
  }

  realPreTaxIncome=function(raw,sp=15900){
    if(raw&lt;=0)return(0)
    sp=as.numeric(sp)
    aftersp_inc=raw-sp
    after_sp_and_tax_inc=aftersp_inc-tax(aftersp_inc)
    tot_after_tax_inc=after_sp_and_tax_inc+sp

    matchfn=function(P){
      abs(P-tax(P)-tot_after_tax_inc)
    }
    optimise(f=matchfn,interval=c(raw,raw+sp),tol=1e-5)$min
  }</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tax</code> function calculates the amount of income tax you have to pay if you earn <code>amount</code>, then <code>realPreTaxIncome</code> calculates your real pre-tax income. The argument <code>raw</code> is the nominal income, and <code>sp</code> is the amount of pre-tax income you are packaging. With health professionals, the cap is $9,010, while for charity it is $15,900 (until you incur some FBT). The last line uses the <code>optimise</code> function to solve for your real income. Strictly speaking, it can be solved analytically. But I just thought using a solver is easier to code. There will no doubt be numerical error, but the magnitude will be irrelevantly small.</p>
<p>I have turn this into a little shiny app. Here you go!</p>
