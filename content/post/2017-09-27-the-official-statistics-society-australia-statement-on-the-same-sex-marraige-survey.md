You can read the full statement [online](//www.statsoc.org.au/publications/media-releases/) or download the [pdf](//www.vision6.com.au/ch/43209/1wzv4/2426453/db4a010x0m.pdf).

But let me give you an excerpt.

>... However, as by design it is not compulsory to vote ... this means that the Postal Survey outcomes -- that is, the proportion of participating electors "in favour" or "against" -- will only be representative of the views of those who respond, rather than representative of the views of all Australians ...
So from this perspective, the results of the Postal Survey, will not represent the views of all Australians.

And an example.

>For example, if younger voters have a lower response rate and are more likely to vote in favour of marriage equality, then the Survey will underestimate the true level of support. The opposite would happen if younger voters had a disproportionately higher response rate.

And a statistical alternative.

>It is the professional opinion of the SSA, the body representing professional statisticians in Australia, that a perhaps more useful Government direction could have asked the Australian Statistician to collect statistics to estimate the proportion of all Australians in favour of or against same-sex marriage.

Of course, making inference from a sample of the population is really what statisticians have been doing for centuries.
