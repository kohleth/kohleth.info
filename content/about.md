Hi, I am a Statistician by training, Data Scientist by (current) job title. I have spent some years doing [Biometrics](//www.biometricsociety.org/about/definition-of-biometrics/), and now working with medical professionals, specifically in [Gait Analysis](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_analysis).

There are many stats/data blog out there but not many are Australian (specifically Melbourne) based, so I decided to start one.
